# My level 1 final project: Dylans Dashboard

### 1. Personal Dashboard$

**Tech:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript  
**Features:**  
✅ Dynamic welcome message based on the time of day  // add a motivational quote via API
✅ Weather widget (Fetch API - OpenWeather)  
✅ To-do list (Local Storage)  
✅ Notes section (Local Storage)  
✅ Navigation between sections (home, weather, tasks, notes)  
✅ Responsive design

Following features: 

To Do List - Just simply a dot point with an x for deleting or tick box when complete. 
Shopping List - Very similar to the to do list just dot point
Notes - Again similar but you can add in a full paragraph note. This could then be for gratitude for the day and showing what you were grateful for yesterday. 
Motivational quote from an API - using https://zenquotes.io/
Weather from API - https://openweathermap.org/
Calendar - google calendar API - https://developers.google.com/workspace/calendar/api/guides/overview

Have all of these on a web page. Navigation at the top takes you to that specific part of the page. 
Alternative is to have widgets or boxes that can all be seen on a normal page that is responsive when moving onto a narrower screen.
